RageDeckCalc
============

ATK Only. Determines best card proc configurations, worst configurations and average attack of a single deck

Has a config file of five cards it takes in, computes the ATK for all 11 skill proc configurations, weighs them based on their probability and reports the individual proc condition ATKs along with the average, also gives the best and worst proc configurations which should highlight any suboptimal deck configurations

Properly supports new duplicate card proc reductions, card skill proc increases and now properly determines card attack by additive bonuses
PROBLEMS
